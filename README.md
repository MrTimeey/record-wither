A small Java library to make working with immutable Java Records easier.  
It provides a convenient **with** method for records to modify single fields immutably.

---

## Installation

Add the dependency from **Maven Central**:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.mrtimeey</groupId>
  <artifactId>record-wither</artifactId>
  <version>${record-wither.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Make your record implement `Withable`

```java
import io.github.mrtimeey.records.Withable;

public record User(String name, int age) implements Withable<User> {}
```

### 2. Use the `with` method

```java
User user = new User("Alice", 30);

// Change one field immutably
User older = user.with(User::age, 31);

System.out.println(older); // User[name=Alice, age=31]
```

---

## Why?

Records in Java are immutable by design.  
While this is great, it means that modifying a single field requires calling the constructor with all parameters again.

`record-wither` provides an easy way to do this, inspired by "with" methods in other languages.
